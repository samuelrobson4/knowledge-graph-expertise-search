In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## PR Comments

<pr-comment-rule>
When I say add a comment to a PR with a TODO on it, use 'checkbox' markdown format to add the TODO.

<example>
- [ ] A description of the todo
</example>
</pr-comment-rule>


## Git
- when creating branches, prefix them with sam/ to indicate they came from me

## Plans
At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer if any. Make the questions extremely concise, sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
